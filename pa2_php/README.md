![Alt text](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~chjun/eecs485/dir.png)

For the following projects, you only need to clone your project repo under `html`.

### For the students who don't use Klein&Smarty (which is highly not recommended!)

Delete the .htaccess file in `html`.

Rename the directory that gets cloned from "pa2_secret" to "secret".

Please put the URL for your home page in your README.md.
