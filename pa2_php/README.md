### New Directory structure


![Alt text](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~chjun/eecs485/dir.png)

For the following projects, you only need to add new directory under `html`. For the students who don't use Klein&Smarty, you can delete .htaccess in `html`. Because your project directory names already include a secret string (e.g. pa1_secret), you don't need to use another secret string. Please put the URL for your home page in your README.md.
